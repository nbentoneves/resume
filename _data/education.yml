    It was very interesting returning to study two/three years later, but unfortunately because of the timetable of classes I decided to only finish the first year of masters degree. When you work and study
    sometimes it's difficult to find a balance between your personal life, school and work. Because of this I decided to not start the second year.

    During my time at ISEP I learned most of the key skills that I have taken through my career such as teamwork and working to tight deadlines.
    They have a lot of group work...this allowed me to develope skills like managing small groups and managing work and delivery dates.
