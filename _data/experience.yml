    Building high quality solutions
  description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
    Working for Flutter, one of the largest gambling companies in the world. As a full-stack engineer, my responsibilities include developing end-to-end user experiences at 
    “free to play”. This involves infrastructure, writing backend, frontend code, and conducting performance tests. 
    I have had the opportunity to lead technical discussions and implement new technologies, such as Redis, within the vertical. This experience has enabled me to assist less experienced developers by helping them configure advanced properties and guiding them in day-to-day implementations within more complex architectures.One of the significant challenges I faced was replacing a blocking location system with a new cloud distribution method for the "free-to-play" platform. This initiative was researched and led by me.

    Building a new SaaS product
  description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
    I worked in a team to build a new SaaS product with the goal of expanding the company to Italy, which presented numerous challenges. This was my first experience as a full-stack developer, where I utilized technologies such as ReactJS and java reactive programming like RxJava and Vert.x.
    In a startup environment with many tasks happening simultaneously, I had the opportunity to research, lead, and contribute to various new implementations and methodologies. One of the key responsibilities was to define a strategy for the team to deliver high-quality results within tight time frames. Together, we successfully implemented a CI/CD environment.
    This role provided a great opportunity for my growth—not only as a developer but also in terms of improving my communication and collaboration skills. In such a fast-paced place, I engaged in a lot of pair programming and participated in valuable technical discussions with my colleagues.

    Working for the utility market in the United Kingdom
  description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
    I have taken on a new challenge in a different country and field, specifically in the electricity and gas utilities sector. I was part of a team responsible for developing new features for the application core and ensuring its stability.
    In addition to implementing new features, my team's responsibilities included addressing issues reported by clients. Given the complexity of the industry, to understanding of these issues and to establish effective testing methods for the solutions, I decided to change my testing approach and adopt a more test-driven development (TDD) methodology.
    This strategy has helped me gain more confidence in delivering bug fixes, while also accelerating my ability to learn about the industry and produce higher-quality work.

    I played a key role in creating and developing one of the largest betting companies in the world!
    Working daily to ensure a healthy system and a backend that operates without major issues is a significant challenge, especially in a company that processes millions of transactions each day. In addition to developing new features and fixing bugs, my routine included verifying reports, analyzing performance graphs, writing documentation, and deploying our services to production.
    During my time at Blip, I had the opportunity to work with a wide range of technologies and architectures. I was part of a highly experienced team and had the privilege of working directly with principal developers and software architects, which provided me with invaluable learning experiences as a mentee.
    One of the most significant opportunities I encountered was migrating a critical service from a monolithic architecture to microservices. Plus, I was involved in implementing Kafka in a distributed system, creating testing tools using behavior driven development (BDD), upgrading Java versions, developing internal tools to support service analyses and conducting performance tests using tools like Gatling.

    At ITSector, I started my career as a Junior Developer. One of my responsibilities was to implement an application similar to Caixa Geral de Depósitos in various countries, including Angola. This was my first experience working with a large monolithic Java repository, where I used some older technologies such as Java EE, Java Server Faces, and the JBoss framework.
