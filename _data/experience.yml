    Working for the utility market in the United Kingdom
  description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
    I have started this new **challenge outside of my country** and in a new field, the utilities market.
    I'm part of a team responsible for developing new features for the application core and maintaining it stable. Also, it's our responsibility to do releases and support customer tickets.
    This has been a good experience because of the direct contact with the customer and the opportunity to implement some improvements around the team,
    such as testing practices, delivery process and scrum processes.

    Working daily to have the system healthy and a backend without any major issues is a ***big challenge*** when you work ***in a company that receives millions of transactions per day***.
    Besides of developing new features or fixing some bugs, part of my routine is to verify reports, check the performance graphics, write documentation and release our services to production.

    This experience was my first part of Blip experience. I did the same tasks as I described above...the only difference is that I was part of a project to ***migrate a monolithic architecture
    software to a microservice architecture***. It was a very good experience that involved migrating code and restructuring a huge pipeline with a lot of dependencies in small pieces.

    It was a very interesting project! The main focus of the project was to build a system that allowed to collect metrics from the electric cars and with those metrics obtain some conclusions about CO2 release
    and the impact for the world. I worked as a backend developer in this project, it was the first time I had an experience with microservices and the ***opportunity to introduce the spring
    framework into the backend department*** (the team was really small and we had space to try new technologies or tools around the company).
