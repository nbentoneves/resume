    An application that will allow you to manage workouts, exercises, athletes or generate workouts!

    This application is not deployed, yet. I started this project because I wanted to learn <mark>reactjs</mark> and <mark>kotlin</mark>.
    I love fitness and because of the COVID-19 I was forced to train at home. I understand some people don't have enough time

    If you want to contribute, please feel free to send me an email <i class="fas fa-envelope-open-text"></i>.

    with primitive data. I started this project because I wanted to try <mark>kotlin</mark>.
